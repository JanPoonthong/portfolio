      <p>I wrote graphic interface Tic Tac Toe (AI) in Python with Pygame library,
          and Pygame comes very handly when building games because it has many methods and functions build in.</p>
      <p>Users can play Tic Tac Toe without any human next to them to play, but instead,
          they can play with the AI and see if the AI is clever enough to beat the user.</p>

      <h4>What I learned:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>I learned how to design grid boxes, and made the boxes visually easy to select for the user to play.</li>
        <li>I learned about Frame Per Second in games and the process for refreshing every second rather than using CPU to run the game.</li>
        <li>I learned about <b>os.path.join</b> so that I didn't need to hardcode the path of picture for X and O.</li>
        <li>I learned about MOUSEDOWN, collision, and track the state of the game.</li>
        <li><span class="important">The most important thing I learned while building Tic Tac Toe
            is thinking logically and reasoning up from fundamental truths.</span></li>

      <p>Space Invaders is a 1978 arcade game. My version is more modern with a graphics interface and high customizable
        with background and bullet images, and smooth moving warship.</p>
      <p>Users can play Space Invaders with just a keyboard. The basic keys are arrows and spaces, the arrows key are for moving,
        and the spaces key for shooting. Users can see the score on the top left corner, and this game is unwinnable because 
        of the infinity enemy generator.</p>

      <h4>What I learned:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>I learned how to load background music to play inside the software.</li>
        <li>I learned how to move images with keys press.</li>
        <li>I learned more about the collision with images.</li>
        <li>I realize that making software needs time and long term commitment.</li>
        <li><span class="important">The most important thing I learned while building Space Invaders is text rending and
          changing with the user action; AKA Score.</span></li>

      <!-- Pong -->
      <a class="anchor" href="https://janpoonthong.github.io/portfolio/microblog.html#pong"><h2 id="pong" class="subtitle">October 4, 2020</h2></a>

      <p>Pong is a table-tennis-themed arcade video game. The main intention of creating Pong was to play with friends and families.
        The two paddles return the ball back and forth. The score is kept by the number at the top of the screen.</p>
      <p>Users can play Pong with just "WS" and "UP / DOWN ARROWS". The wide paddle makes users feel less frustrated. As mentioned,
        the reason I created Pong was to play with friends and families and have a fun time rather than competing.</p>

      <h4>What I learned:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>I learned how to use the turtle module</li>
        <li>I learned <b>turtle.ontimer(tick, 10)</b>. So that speed of the ball doesn't depend on the CPU GHz</li>
        <li>I learned how to keep track of the score</li>
        <li>While building Pong, I deeply understand functions, while, and global variables</li>
        <li><span class="important">The most important thing I learned while building Pong is, even a basic module like turtle
          could build one complete game.</span></li>
