      <p>I wrote graphic interface Tic Tac Toe (AI) in Python with Pygame library,
          and Pygame comes very handly when building games because it has many methods and functions build in.</p>
      <p>Users can play Tic Tac Toe without any human next to them to play, but instead,
          they can play with the AI and see if the AI is clever enough to beat the user.</p>

      <h4>What I learned:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>I learned how to design grid boxes, and made the boxes visually easy to select for the user to play.</li>
        <li>I learned about Frame Per Second in games and the process for refreshing every second rather than using CPU to run the game.</li>
        <li>I learned about <b>os.path.join</b> so that I didn't need to hardcode the path of picture for X and O.</li>
        <li>I learned about MOUSEDOWN, collision, and track the state of the game.</li>
        <li><span class="im">The most important thing I learned while building tic tac toe
            is thinking logically and reasoning up from fundamental truths.</span></li>
