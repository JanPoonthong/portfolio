        Sus Editor is a text editor with Pixels VGA Font. Written with Simple
        DirectMedia Layer is a cross-platform development library designed to
        provide low-level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and
        graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D.
      </p>
      <p>

        Space Invaders is a two-dimensional fixed shooter game in which the
        player controls a ship with lasers by moving the y-axis across the
        bottom of the screen. The ship will have unlimited lasers to fire at
        descending aliens.
      </p>
      <p>
        The basic keys are arrows and spaces, the arrows key are for moving, and
        the spaces key for firing. Users can see the score on the top left
        corner and their live status on the top right corner.

        Hangman is a guessing letters game, the player can only guess one letter
        at a time to solve the word puzzle.
      </p>
      <h4>Hacks to win:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Try guessing the vowels</strong>- A good strategy is to guess
          a few vowels. With five vowels in the English alphabet, you'll quickly
          see some word patterns.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Etaoin shrdlu</strong>- "Etaoin shrdlu" is just a list of the
          most common letters used in English, so try to guess these letters.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>What I learned:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>I learned how to see patterns and not to use duplicate code.</li>
        <li>I learned <b>if __name__ == "__main__"</b>.</li>
        <li>
          I learned the importance of algorithm, for example; WIDTH / 2 -
          text.get_width() / 2, HEIGHT / 2 - text.get_height() / 2 = Center of
          screen.
        </li>
        <li>
          While building Hangman, I understand making use of capitalizing
          variables for constant.

          <span class="important"

      <p>
        Pong is a table-tennis-themed arcade video game. The main intention of
        creating Pong was to play with friends and families. The two paddles
        return the ball back and forth. The score is kept by the number at the
        top of the screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users can play Pong with just "WS" and "UP / DOWN ARROWS". The wide
        paddle makes users feel less frustrated. As mentioned, the reason I
        created Pong was to play with friends and families and have a fun time
        rather than competing.

        <li>I learned how to use the turtle module</li>

        <li>I learned how to keep track of the score</li>

            <p>Space Invaders is a 1978 arcade game. My version is more modern with a graphics interface and high customizable
                with background and bullet images, and smooth moving warship.
            </p>
            <p>Users can play Space Invaders with just a keyboard. The basic keys are arrows and spaces, the arrows key are for
                moving,
                and the spaces key for shooting. Users can see the score on the top left corner, and this game is unwinnable
                because
                of the infinity enemy generator.

      <p>
        I wrote the graphic interface Tic Tac Toe (AI) in Python with Pygame
        library, and Pygame comes very handly when building games because it has
        many methods and functions built in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users can play Tic Tac Toe without any human next to them to play, but
        instead, they can play with the AI and see if the AI is clever enough to
        beat the user.

        <li>
          I learned about Frame Per Second in games and the process for
          refreshing every second rather than using CPU to run the game.
        </li>
        <li>
          I learned about <b>os.path.join</b> so that I didn't need to hardcode
